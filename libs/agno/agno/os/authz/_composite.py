"""Run two authorization planes on one AgentOS, in parallel.

Real deployments often have two populations hitting the same OS:

- **Operators** — admins managing the OS through the agno-os frontend. agno's
  control plane mints them a token that already carries scopes, so they're
  authorized straight from the token (a :class:`ScopeAuthorizationProvider`).
- **End users** — the customer's own users, whose access is managed at runtime in
  the OS-local :class:`~agno.os.authz.role_store.ManagedRoleStore`. Their token
  carries identity; the store decides.

A single provider can't be both "trust the token's scopes" and "ignore the token,
ask the store." The public way to run several planes is to pass a **list** of
providers to ``AuthorizationConfig`` / ``AgentOS`` — a request is allowed if any
of them allows it::

    AuthorizationConfig(authorization_provider=[
        ScopeAuthorizationProvider(),   # operators: scopes from the token
        roles.provider,                 # end users: the OS-local managed store
    ])

AgentOS composes that list with the internal class below. It's an OR, so order
only affects which provider is consulted first, not the outcome;
``accessible_resource_ids`` returns the union (``{"*"}`` wins). This class is an
implementation detail — prefer the list form above.

    composition is an OR, a provider can only ever *widen* access — it can never
    restrict what another provider grants. Do NOT add a provider whose purpose is
    to deny (an IP fence, a compliance/step-up gate); under OR its "deny" is
    silently overridden by any other provider's "allow". Such a control belongs
    upstream (middleware) or inside a single provider's own logic, not as a peer
