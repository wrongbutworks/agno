"""Audit trail for authorization changes.

There are two kinds of "audit" people mean, and we keep them in two separate
tables (see :class:`DbAuditSink`) because they answer different questions:

1. Decision audit ("was alice allowed to run agent X, and with which token?") —
   recorded by the JWT middleware on every protected request when an
   :class:`AuditSink` is set on ``AuthorizationConfig(audit=...)``. Each row is an
   ``access.allowed`` / ``access.denied`` event with the principal, the route, the
   required scopes, the caller's scopes, and a NON-secret token reference (the
   token's ``jti`` when present, otherwise a short hash — never the token itself).
   (The native policy engine also logs every decision to the ``agno.authz.engine``
   logger; ``ManagedRoleStore(decision_log=True)`` bumps it to INFO.)

2. Change audit ("who granted alice the admin role, when, before/after?") — the
   policy engine cannot provide this: it never sees the acting principal, and its
   policy rows are overwrite-in-place with no history. So it must be captured at
   the layer that knows the actor — the management API / store. Plug an
   :class:`AuditSink` into :class:`~agno.os.authz.role_store.ManagedRoleStore`
   (directly or via ``get_roles_router``) and every role/assignment mutation emits
   a structured, append-only :class:`AuditEvent` with the actor and before/after.

The same :class:`DbAuditSink` instance can serve both: ``record()`` routes change
events to ``authz_audit`` and decision events to ``authz_decisions``.

    The two kinds of audit are kept in two physically separate tables, because

    different rates:

    - **changes** (``authz_audit``): who granted/changed a role, with before/after.
      Low volume, one row per admin action.
    - **decisions** (``authz_decisions``): every allow/deny on a request, with the
      required scopes, the granted scopes, and a non-secret token reference. High
      volume, one row per protected request.

    Keeping them apart means a decision-log flood never buries the change trail,
    each table has only the columns it needs, and you can retain/export them on
    different schedules. ``record()`` routes by action; you read each side with
    :meth:`read` (changes) and :meth:`read_decisions`.

    Writes are INSERT-only — rows are never updated or deleted — so both tables are
    tamper-evident trails suitable for SOC2-style evidence. Point it at the same DB
    as the role store or a separate one.
