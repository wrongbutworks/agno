"""Pluggable authorization providers for AgentOS.

The ``AuthorizationProvider`` interface is the seam between AgentOS's request
handling and the logic that decides "can this principal do this action on this
resource". The built-in :class:`ScopeAuthorizationProvider` implements the
existing JWT-scope RBAC with zero external dependencies, so the default
behaviour is unchanged.

Customers who need a richer model (relationship-based / ReBAC, attribute-based,
or an external engine such as OpenFGA, SpiceDB or Cerbos) implement the same
interface and pass it via ``AuthorizationConfig(authorization_provider=...)``.

Managed roles (runtime-editable RBAC) are backed by agno's own
:class:`NativePolicyEngine` behind the swappable :class:`PolicyEngine` port — no
third-party policy engine in the default path.
